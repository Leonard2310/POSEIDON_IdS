# Poseidon: Maritime Ticketing Application for Navigation Companies

Poseidon is a software engineering project developed for Federico II University. The project aims to create an application for navigation companies to streamline the issuance of tickets for maritime travel. The specific company for which the application is designed is named Poseidon. The company offers passenger transportation services operated by hydrofoils and ferries, as well as passenger and vehicle transportation services operated by ferries.

## Project Description
Use case modeling was employed to define the interactions between system actors and the application. Actors such as employees and customers were identified, and their interactions with the system were described through various use cases. These use cases were captured in a use case diagram, providing a visual representation of the system's functionality. Detailed scenarios were developed to describe the flow of events for each use case.

A class diagram was created to depict the system's classes, their relationships, and attributes, offering a structural overview of the system's architecture. Sequence diagrams were also constructed to illustrate the dynamic interactions between objects during different scenarios, showcasing the sequence of messages exchanged between objects.

Cost estimation was performed to estimate the project's expenses, including development effort and resources required. A comprehensive functional test plan was devised to ensure the correctness of the system. This plan included test cases and procedures to be executed during the testing phase.

The system was implemented using Java and SQL, following object-oriented principles and best practices. Eclipse IDE was utilized for development, and PostgreSQL was chosen as the database management system.

Testing encompassed both structural and functional aspects. Structural testing assessed the cyclomatic complexity of the code to measure its structural complexity and identify areas that required additional testing. Functional testing was conducted based on the test plan to verify the system's compliance with the specified requirements.

## Requirements
- Eclipse IDE (version 2022-2023 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (version 42.3.5 or higher)

## Results
The Poseidon application successfully enables navigation companies to efficiently issue tickets for maritime travel. The application supports both passenger and vehicle ticketing, allowing the company to manage their fleet, schedule trips, and ensure seat availability. The system provides a user-friendly interface for employees to issue tickets, record issuance details, and update seat availability. Customers can also make online reservations, which are processed by company employees upon presentation of a reservation printout.

The project involved a thorough analysis and requirement specification process. A noun-verb analysis was conducted to identify key entities and actions, and the requirements were reviewed and refined. A glossary of terms was created to ensure a common understanding of terminology. The requirements were classified into functional requirements, data requirements, and constraints/other requirements.
